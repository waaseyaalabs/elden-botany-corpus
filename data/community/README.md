# Community Annotations Workspace

This directory stores contributor-owned bundles plus the processed artifacts generated by the community ingestion pipeline.

```
data/community/
├── bundles/            # Author-maintained annotation bundles (YAML + assets)
├── processed/          # Pipeline outputs (Parquet tables, manifests, logs)
└── README.md           # This file
```

- The `bundles/` tree is intentionally gitignored because contributors may attach large reference assets.
- The `processed/` directory is also ignored because it contains generated Parquet files and manifests.
- Run `poetry run corpus community init` to scaffold a new bundle and `poetry run corpus community ingest` to materialize processed outputs under `processed/`.
